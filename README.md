#A Minimum Connected Dominating Set Problem solver

This is the source code of the BTS algorithm proposed in paper:

Breakout Tabu Search for the Minimum Connected Dominating Set Problem


##How to use
The files in the folder /instances are the instances files used in the paper.
Please create a folder named "result" in the root folder of the project.
The code will not happy if it is not there.
This folder stores the results got by the algorithm.
